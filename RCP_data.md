# Climate Change Data
### Here you find information about the climate change data. 
The data is based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs) adopted by the [5th IPCC report in 2014](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/). These pathways present different scenarios of future climate change depending on the emission during the 21st century. The climate change effects range from low temperature changes to extreme temperature changes by the end of the 21st century.

We included **three** different RCPs to represent the wide spectrum of change:
+ **RCP2.6**: an optimisitc scenario where emissions peak in the 2020s and afterwards constantly reduce. This results in low climate change impacts and keeps temperature increase below 2°C.
+ **RCP4.5**: an intermediate scenario where emissions increase but flatten out in the second half of 21st century. This results in intermediate climate change impacts and a temperature increase between 2 - 3°C.
+ **RCP8.5**: the worst-case scenario where emissions continue to increase throughout 21st century. This results in extreme climate change impacts and a temperature increase up to 5°C.

The climate data itself consists of daily temperature and precipitation. It was provided by the CORDEX project and the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC). Each of the three scenarios is represented by **10** different underlying models to account for uncertainties and make the data more reliable.
All data is bias-correct following [ISIMIP](https://www.isimip.org/gettingstarted/isimip3b-bias-adjustment/) and has a resoultion of ~12.5km.

For your region we extracted the data for one representative coordinate in the middle of your region.
