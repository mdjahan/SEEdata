# Climate Change Data
### Here you find information about the climate change data. 
The data is based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs) adopted by the [5th IPCC report in 2014](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/). These pathways present different scenarios of future climate change depending on the emission during the 21st century. The climate change effects range from low temperature changes to extreme temperature changes by the end of the 21st century.

We included **three** different RCPs to represent the wide spectrum of change:
+ **RCP2.6**: an optimisitc scenario where emissions peak in the 2020s and afterwards constantly reduce. This results in low climate change impacts and a temperature increase by ~2Â°C.
+ **RCP4.5**:
