# Socio-Economic Change Data
### Here you find information about the future socio-economic data. 
The data is based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) developed by [O'Neill et al. in 2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0905-2adopted) and further adopted by the [6th IPCC report in 2021](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/). These pathways present different scenarios of future socio-economic development of the world.

We included all **five** different SSPs to represent the wide spectrum of potential change:
+ **SSP1 Sustainability** - A future focused on sustainable development, fairness, and taking care of the environment. It includes using advanced technology, having a stable population, and consuming resources in a sustainable way.
+ **SSP2 Middle of the Road** - A future where things continue as they are, with moderate changes to how society and the environment are managed. It assumes gradual economic growth, a moderate increase in population, and some efforts to address sustainability issues.
+ **SSP3 Regional Rivalry** - A future marked by large gaps between different regions and limited cooperation between countries. Economic growth is uneven, population increases significantly, and each country prioritizes its own interests over global collaboration.
+ **SSP4 Inequality** - A future with strong economic growth and policies driven by market forces, resulting in high levels of inequality. Population grows rapidly, social and environmental policies are limited, and there is little investment in sustainable technologies.
+ **SSP5 Fossil-fueled Development** - A future where economic growth is the main goal, and fossil fuels play a major role. Population grows quickly, environmental regulations are weak, and international cooperation is limited. Renewable energy and climate change efforts are not given much attention.

We received the underlying data from different sources:
+ **Population**: gridded data by [Wang et al. (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01675-x) and [Jones & O'Neill (2016)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084003/meta)
+ **Gross domestic product**: gridded data by [Wang & Sun (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01300-x) and [Murakami et al. (2021)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbuil.2021.760306/full)
+ **Wood price**: resolution on EU-regional level (wood price) modelled by [GLOBIOM from Lauri et al. (2019)](https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/16163/)

The data was extracted for each region on a **NUTS3** level and changes were averagde over this area and adapted to observed historical data provided by Eurostat.
