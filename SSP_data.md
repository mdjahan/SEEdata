# Socio-Economic Change Data
### Here you find information about the future socio-economic data. 
The data is based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) developed by [O'Neill et al. in 2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0905-2adopted) and further adopted by the [6th IPCC report in 2021(https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/). These pathways present different scenarios of future climate change depending on the emission during the 21st century. The climate change effects range from low temperature changes to extreme temperature changes by the end of the 21st century.

We included **three** different RCPs to represent the wide spectrum of change:
+ **RCP2.6**: an optimisitc scenario where emissions peak in the 2020s and afterwards constantly reduce. This results in low climate change impacts and keeps temperature increase below 2°C.
+ **RCP4.5**: an intermediate scenario where emissions increase but flatten out in the second half of 21st century. This results in intermediate climate change impacts and a temperature increase between 2 - 3°C.
+ **RCP8.5**: the worst-case scenario where emissions continue to increase throughout 21st century. This results in extreme climate change impacts and a temperature increase up to 5°C.
